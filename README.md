# Kata : Library Management System

## Description
The Library Management System is a simple application built to manage books in a library. It allows users to add new books, borrow available books, return borrowed books, and view a list of all available books. This project is developed in Python using TDD (Test-Driven Development) and follows SOLID principles to ensure maintainable and extensible code.

## Problem Statement

Create a simple library management system that allows users to perform basic operations such as adding books, borrowing books, returning books, and viewing available books.

## Requirements

### Add Books:

- Users should be able to add new books to the library.
- Each book should have a unique identifier (e.g., ISBN), title, author, and publication year.

### Borrow Books:

- Users should be able to borrow a book from the library.
- The system should ensure that the book is available before allowing it to be borrowed.
- If the book is not available, the system should raise an appropriate error.

### Return Books:

- Users should be able to return a borrowed book.
- The system should update the availability of the book accordingly.

### View Available Books:

- Users should be able to view a list of all available books in the library.


## Features

The Library Management System provides the following key features:

**1. Add Books**

  - Functionality: Allows users to add new books to the library.
  - Details:<br>
        - Each book has a unique identifier (ISBN), title, author, and publication year.<br>
        - Books are stored in the library  and marked as available by default.

**2. Borrow Books**

  - Functionality: Enables users to borrow books from the library.
  - Details:<br>
        - Before borrowing, the system checks if the book is available.<br>
        - If the book is available, it is marked as borrowed (availability set to false).<br>
        - If the book is not available, the system raises a BookNotAvailableException.

**3. Return Books**

  - Functionality: Allows users to return books they have borrowed.
  - Details:<br>
        - When a book is returned, it is marked as available again (availability set to true).<br>
        - The system ensures that the returned book is part of the libraryâ€™s collection.

**4. View Available Books**

  - Functionality: Users can view a list of all books currently available in the library.
  - Details:<br>
        - The system filters out borrowed books and displays only those marked as available.<br>
        - Users can see the title, author, and publication year of each available book.


## Best Practices Followed

  - **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: Tests were written before implementing the features.
  - **SOLID Principles**: The code follows SOLID principles to ensure maintainability and scalability.
  - **Clean Code**: The code is well-structured, with meaningful variable and method names, making it easy to read and maintain.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or above
-unittest module (comes pre-installed with Python)

## Test Summary

This project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, ensuring that all functionalities are thoroughly tested. The test cases cover various scenarios, including adding books, borrowing available books, returning borrowed books, and viewing available books.

### Testing Freamwork:

- unittest: Python's built-in testing framework is used to write and execute the tests.
